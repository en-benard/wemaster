<!-- this is a subheadline -->
I am a Biologist & GIS/RS Researcher.

My enthusiasm is in geospatial data analysis/science; and modeling biological phenomena with machine learning. My goal is to champion climate change effects on flora (all plant life) and fauna (all animal life) through creation of risk map (cartography), models and trends using big data in open source software.
