  Recent surge in tropical catastrophes have encouraged tapping into technology and reproducible coding. Species distribution and statistical model use data (data-oriented) and expert systems for insights on niche-climate relationship. Elaborate analysis is performed by machine learning (ML) algorithms to precisely improve on the predictability. GIS tools and software visualizes the models and produce informative risk maps.

  This platform will integrate GIS/RS and ML skills in R/python for geospatial analysis and predicting species distribution.
